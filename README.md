# Factory Pattern Dojo

### Description
We love pizza!
 

### Requirements
 * node 8+


### How To start
This branch is just a starting point. To go to first step - checkout branch `factory-step-1` and 
follow instructions in updated Readme.

### Step-1
Run tests found in **test/tests.js**. The tests will fail. Your job is to make the tests pass. You cannot change implementation of tests, but you have to change implementation of existing classes. In this step implement correct interfaces in classes.

CheesePizza
PepperoniPizza
VeggiePizza

If your tests are passing, go ahead and checkout the **factory-step-2** branch and follow the instructions from the Readme document.

### Step-2
There are new tests in **test/tests.js**. If you run these tests, you will see that they fail. Your job in this step is to provide implementation of methods in the concrete Pizza classes so that the tests will pass. 

If your tests are passing, go ahead and checkout the **factory-step-3** branch and follow the instructions from the Readme document.

### Step-3
Solutions to **factory-step-3** can be found in this branch.
